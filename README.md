It's a repository to track my path through the over the wire levels

available at https://overthewire.org/wargames/

Some notes:
I used a vim macro to create all my files for the bandit game, today I learned that i could have done it using expansions, in this way `touch level-{0..34}.txt`

I'll update it with some things that I found interesting to know (at least for me)
