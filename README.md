It's a repository to track my path through the over the wire levels, available at https://overthewire.org/wargames/

I'll update it with some things that I found interesting to know (at least for me)

Some notes:
I used a vim macro to create all my files for the bandit game, today I learned that i could have done it using expansions, in this way `touch {00..34}-level.md`
